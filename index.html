                            it ruins their relationship with others and it leads to burnout.

                            A home isn't a home until you've decorated a little. People either 
                            don't decorate, or they go overboard and it doesn't have the impact
                            they were hoping for. Staying simple will help draw the
                            eye where you want it to and make things pop like never before.
